Source code for the new SIM card flaw which lets hijack any phone just by sending SMS - Source Code + Demo Video

### Where's the source code ? 👿

That's what am asking you!! Where is it ? 

### Why did I create this repo ? 💡

Like you, I am very curios about sim-jacking. I searched for the same shit you're searching for. I didn't get any source code
or demo. I became sad :(,  so I thought searching with someone else would be more efficient searching alone ?,
but how can I form a group ? So I created this. ;)
